    <h3>1. The information we acquire</h3>
    <h3>We Collect Information About You:</h3>
    <p  className="blog">In certain areas of the Sites, such as those in which you complete a profile, submit your resume, create a new account, or enter TrueTalent-sponsored contests or promotions, we may request certain personal information from you, including your email address, first and last name, postal code, phone number, profession, work experience, social media information, photographs, ethnicity, gender, citizenship, and work eligibility. In such cases, we may attempt to determine which informative pieces are needed and which are optional.

</p>
<h3>Personal Information We Collect Passively:</h3>
<p  className="blog">We passively collect and aggregate information revealing, among other things, which pages were viewed, in what sequence, and which links were "clicked" when visitors utilise the Services. Collecting this information requires the collection and logging of IP addresses, MAC addresses, operating systems, device types, mobile ad identifiers, browsing history, search history, and information regarding an individual's interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement, as well as the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and browser software utilised by each user of the Services. In some situations, we may gather geolocation-based information to assist in identifying available opportunities in your region.

The information we gather enables us to assess the most popular parts of the Sites and the efficacy of our marketing campaigns. In addition, we may share some of this information with advertisers in order to tell them of the number of persons who have watched and/or clicked on their ads.</p>
<p  className="blog">Children & Minors - TrueTalent's offerings are unavailable to anybody under the age of 18. We do not intentionally gather personal information from minors less than 18 years old.</p><br />
<p  className="blog">Please be aware that we cannot regulate the actions of our Service users. All members and visitors should be aware that when personal information is disclosed in a resume, profile, or other media, it may be collected and utilised by third parties to send unwanted email from parties outside TrueTalent. Please email privacy@TrueTalent.io if you come across a TrueTalent user who is inappropriately collecting or utilising information about you or other users.</p><br />

Personal information, such as blog postings, may be included in indexed material. In general, such indexed material is accessible through ordinary search engines or by visiting public websites directly. We integrate this information with what we already know about you. This assists us in updating, expanding, and analysing our data, identifying new consumers, and providing goods and services that may be of interest to you. Whether or not a person has an account with us, FindrPro may add this information to your profile or use this material to establish a profile.
